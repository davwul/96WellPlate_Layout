# 96WellPlate_Layout
Created an easy to use program to generate images of layouts for 96-well plate experiments in the lab.

Built with a GUI using tkinter and customtkinter. Generates images of 96-well plates using matplotlib.

Features that will be implemented in the future:

* Allow user to add a custom Label, currently only supports 'ConditionName', 'ConditionValue', 'CellsPerWell', 'Donor'.
* Generate Excel file with Labels for each Well ID
* Even better looking GUI...



**Here is an example**

<img src="plot.jpg" alt="How it looks when printed:" width="800"/>
